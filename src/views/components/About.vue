          <p>Batis-YOGHI emerged from the Children and Youth Development Program (CYDP) of Batis Center for Women, an NGO working to address the needs and concerns of returned distressed Filipino women migrant workers returning from Japan. The program caters to the needs of the children of the clients of Batis Center, majority of whom are Japanese-Filipino children (JFC). While their cases for legal recognition and child support from their Japanese fathers were ongoing, the CYDP provided venues and opportunities for the JFCs to discuss and come to terms with the issues that they face as children of migrant workers, learn about their rights, and involve themselves in self-development activities. Importantly as well, the program organized the children to provide support to one another and address the issues confronting them as children of migrant workers.</p>
          <p>In the year 2000, with the encouragement and initiative of the CYDP, the children and youth under the program formed Batis-YOGHI or Youth Organization that Gives Hope and Inspiration (YOGHI). That same year the youth organization elected their own set of officers and drafted their constitution and by-laws.</p>
          <p>Batis-YOGHI actively involves its members in activities that promote self-development in order for them to be empowered and ready in overcoming the challenges and difficulties that they face as they grow older.</p>
          <p>Presently, Batis-YOGHI gains recognition in the Philippines as one of the lead organizations for Japanese-Filipino children. It continues to be the voice of JFC and children of migrant workers and serves as hope and inspiration to the youth.</p>
